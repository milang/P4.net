      <remarks>
        Forms are the things that pop-up in an editor when run from a command line.  In
        P4.Net (and most other Perforce APIs), you do not need to parse/format the text manually.
        Instead, you can get/set the fields using the Fields and ArrayFields collections.
        <P>The following is a list of common form commands:</P>
        <list>
          <li>client</li>
          <li>branch</li>
          <li>label</li>
          <li>job</li>
          <li>user</li>
          <li>group</li>
          <li>protect</li>
          <li>triggers</li>
          <li>branch</li>
        </list>
        <P>
          When fetching or saving a form, <B>do not use the '-o' and '-i' flags</B>.  P4.Net will automatically include them.
        </P>

      <example>
        The following example updates the current client.  It changes the client root, and adds a line to the view.
        <code language="C#" escaped="true">
          P4Connection p4 = new P4Connection();
          p4.Connect();

          P4Form MyClient = p4.Fetch_Form("client");

          //Change the root and properties
          MyClient["Root"] = @"C:\p4\P4.NetClient";
          MyClient["Description"] = "Created from P4.Net!";

          //Fetch the clientName (for use later in building the view spec).
          string clientName = MyClient["Client"];

          // Build a new array, that has one more element than the current view
          string[] NewView = new string[MyClient.ArrayFields["View"].Length + 1];

          // Copy the existing view lines to the new array
          MyClient.ArrayFields["View"].CopyTo(NewView,0);

          // Set the new view line
          NewView[NewView.Length - 1] = string.Format("//depot/newpath/... //{0}/newpath/...", clientName);

          MyClient.ArrayFields["View"] = NewView;

          // Save the form
          P4UnParsedRecordSet MyResult = p4.Save_Form(MyClient);
          p4.Disconnect();
        </code>
      </example>

    <P4Connection>
      <remarks>
        <p>
          The P4Connection class is the main player in P4.Net. This represents a connection
          to the Perforce server. Every utility that uses P4.Net will have some variation
          of the following code:
        </p>
          <code language="C#" escaped="true">
P4Connection p4 = new P4Connection();
p4.Connect();

// Run some commands
p4.Disconnect();</code>
        <p>
          Rule number 1: Always remember to disconnect. This frees unmanaged memory, and cleanly
          disconnects from the Perforce server. P4Connection implements IDisposable, and the
          Dispose and Disconnect methods can be used interchangeably.
        </p>
        <p>
          P4.Net is based off the command-line syntax (as are most other Perforce APIs). Almost
          all of the commands you issue in P4.Net will use the same arguments as the p4 client
          executable. For example, say you need to find the latest submitted changelist under
          a given path (//depot/path).
        </p>
        <para>From the command line:</para>
          <code language="C#">
c:\&gt; p4 changes -m1 -s submitted //depot/path/...</code>
        <para>From P4.Net:</para>
          <code language="C#" escaped="true">
P4Connect p4 = new P4Connection();
p4.Connect();
P4Recordset changes = p4.Run("changes", "-m1", "-s", "submitted", "//depot/path/...");
p4.Disconnect();</code>
        <p>
          If you don’t know what all the arguments for p4 changes mean, then <c>p4 help changes</c>
          is your best friend. The first step in building anything with P4.Net, is to know
          the exact command lines you’d run manually.

    <OnPrompt>
      <example>
        The following sample will change the user's password.
        <code language="C#" escaped="true">
public class PasswordSetter
{
    private P4Connection _p4 = null;
    private string _oldPassword = "";
    private string _newPassword = "";
    PasswordSetter(P4Connection p4)
    {
        _p4 = p4;
    }

    public void SetPassword(string OldPassword, string NewPassword)
    {
        OnPromptEventHandler eh = new OnPromptEventHandler(OnPrompt);
        _p4.OnPrompt += eh;

        _oldPassword = OldPassword;
        _newPassword = NewPassword;

        //run passwd
        P4UnParsedRecordSet r = _p4.RunUnParsed("passwd");

        //Clear the event just in case
        _p4.OnPrompt -= eh;

        //Clear the passwords from memory
        _newPassword = "";
        _oldPassword = "";
    }

    private void OnPrompt(object sender, P4PromptEventArgs e)
    {
        switch (e.Message)
        {
            case ("Enter old password: "):
                e.Response = _oldPassword;
                break;
            case ("Enter new password: "):
                e.Response = _newPassword;
                break;
            case ("Re-enter new password: "):
                e.Response = _newPassword;
                break;
        }
    }
} 
        </code>
      </example>
    </OnPrompt>
    <Changelist>
      <remarks>
        The P4PendindingChangelist object is used to submit files with P4.Net.  The first step
        is to create a new pending changelist, then add the switches "-c", and "1234" 
        (1234 is the changelist number) to all commands that are opening files.

        In P4.Net, there’s no straight-forward way to submit the default pending changelist.
        This is by design. If the client workspace has opened files in the default changelist
        before any P4.Net automation runs, those files will "come along for the ride" when
        you submit the default changelist. If the user has a JobView set, all jobs in that
        JobView will automatically be fixed when you submit the default changelist.
        Both of those behaviors are almost never desired, and I’ve found many scripts that
        have those bugs.
      </remarks>
      <example>
        The following example demonstrates submiting files with P4PendingChangelist.
        <code language="C#" escaped="true">
P4Connection p4 = new P4Connection();
p4.Connect();
P4PendingChangelist  cl = p4.CreatePendingChangelist("My New Changelist\nVery, Very bad description!\nShame on me!");
p4.Run("edit", "-c", cl.Number.ToString(), "//depot/path/foo.cs", "//depot/path/bar.cs");
// Do something to manipulate the files
cl.Submit();
p4.Disconnect();
      </code>

    </Changelist>
